Hope it looks good to you!

[x] I ran DRC and there are 0 errors

## CAD
Designed two using OpenSCAD! I edited my previous macropad case for the keyboard

It's made to be 3D printed, and as it doesn't need supports nor any post processing, mass produce.

## Firmware

I wrote the firmware using kmk, you can see it inside the repo. It's pretty simple, but I'm proud of it!

## IMPORTANT

- Dont send the 3d printed case  
    I'll print it myself so I'll get less customs fees.
- Don't send the soldering iron  
  I have one, less electronics waste, less customs fees.
